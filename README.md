Repository for CodSoft ML internship tasks:

## Task 1 - Movie Genre Classification  
A machine learning project that predicts the **genre of a movie** based on its **plot summary** using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.  
This project was developed and tested in **PyCharm**, using models trained with **TF-IDF** and **Logistic Regression / Naive Bayes**.
## Task 2 - Credit Card Fraud Detection
A machine learning project to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
This project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, threshold tuning, and a Streamlit web app for real-time fraud prediction.
## Task 3 - Customer Churn Prediction 
To **predict customer churn** — identifying customers likely to discontinue using a service — using **Machine Learning** techniques.  
The goal is to help businesses take proactive actions to improve customer retention.
## Task 4 - Spam SMS Detection
An **AI model that classifies SMS messages as Spam or Legitimate (Ham)** using machine learning techniques such as **TF-IDF vectorization** and algorithms like **Naive Bayes**, **Logistic Regression**, and **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**.
